# This script is called in ProxyVM after firewall every update (configuration
# change, starting some VM etc). This is good place to write own custom
# firewall rules, in addition to autogenerated one. Remember that in most cases
# you'll need to insert the rules at the beginning (iptables -I) to have it
# efective.

# You need to make this script executable to have it enabled.
